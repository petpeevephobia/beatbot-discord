# beatBot!: Discord bot

One of my hobbies include writing and creating music. I play acoustic and electric guitar as well ukulele. Furthermore, I plan to take up drums and the cajon. Because of this passion, a goal of mine is to be a singer-songwriter as a side hustle when I become more experienced in the field of music. Hence, I built beatBot! A personal Discord bot that would guide me along on the basic knowledge of music theory. Oftentimes I would return to beatBot whenever I need resources or inspiration to write music.

This is a simple bot, so I believe it can be further improved to offer more features. Some examples would be updating users on the latest viral songs, news articles regarding the music industry and a generator that inspires users on chord progressions or melodies they can use. If this project goes well, I hope to offer this tool to aspiring music artists who are struggling to seek inspiration.

# Struggles
This is my first time using an API to create a working program. I had to sit through numerous YouTube tutorials and constantly refer to the discord.py documentations. For example, there was a moment when I was not sure how to call a function that would ping a Discord user in the server. I had no idea that each Discord user had a personal uder token and that you could access it by tinkering with the software settings.

I used the discord.py package to build beatBot!

# HOW TO RUN
** Only I am able to run beatBot because a unique token is required.
